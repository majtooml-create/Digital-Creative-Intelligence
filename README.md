## 📦 Currently Available
- `dcisystem.py`: Core D.C.I architecture (illustrative pseudocode from Section 5.1)
- `ethical_validator.py`: Embedded ethics governance module (Section 6.2)
- This repository provides the **minimal reproducible core** of the D.C.I framework.

## 📥 To Be Released Upon Acceptance
The following components will be published in full upon journal acceptance or upon reasonable academic request:
- Full dataset of 3,600 evaluation tasks (`tasks/`)
- D.C.I Assessment Suite (`dcias/`)
- Reproducible experiment runner (`experiment_runner.py`)
- Detailed human evaluation templates and statistical pipelines

## 🧪 Reproducibility
All experiments in the paper use **fixed model versions**:
- GPT-4 (`gpt-4-0613`)
- Claude 2.1
- Stable Diffusion XL 1.0
